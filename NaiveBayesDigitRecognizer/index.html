   <h4> Statistical Data Analysis/Learning Algorithms </h4>
   <p>My recent research involved theoretical study of impure/disordered material using high energy physics tool the so called "holography", where I performed extensive statistical data analysis; material are impure in "random" ways, but often the underlying distribution function is known or there are good guesses. 
   In particular, I had to employ clustering learning algorithm for data compression among other things (basic inferential data analysis, in particular hypothesis testing).</p>
   <h4>Programming/scripting Languages</h4>
    I often code in Java, C or Python. For data analysis, I mostly use <b>R</b> or <a href="http://www.maplesoft.com"> Maple</a>.
   <h4>Courses</h4>
    <ul>  
      <li> Completed "Machine Learning" by Andrew Ng on <a href="https://www.Coursera.org"> Coursera</a>. Here is my <a href="http://www.omidsaremi.org/machine_learning_certificate.pdf"> certificate</a> (statement of accomplishment).  </li>
      <li> Completed "Computing for Data Analysis" by Roger Peng on Coursera. It included an introduction to <b>R</b> as well. Find my <a href="http://www.omidsaremi.org/computing_data_analysis_certificate.pdf">certificate</a> here. </li> 
      <li> Completed "An Introduction to Hadoop and MapReduce" at <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/ud617">Udacity</a>. Here is the <a href="http://omidsaremi.org/Hadoop_certificate.pdf"> verified certificate</a>. A short description of the project appears below.</li>
      <li> Completed "Social Network Analysis" by Lada Adamic at U of Michigan on Coursera. Here is the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/records/GamsETzbXamct6tW">certificate</a>
    </ul>
   <h4> Knowledge projects:</h4>
    </p> Inspired by my research needs and the Machine Learning course, I developed the following Java application and deployed them successfully:<p>   
   <ol> 
    <li> A Java application which implements K-means unsupervised learning algorithm, 
    in the context of an image color quantizer. The Java linear algebra library <a href="https://code.google.com/p/efficient-java-matrix-library/">EJML</a> (Efficient Java Matrix Library) was used.
    The code does not use any of the pre-existing Machine Learning libraries such as <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/">scikit-learn</a>. The application comes with a simple Java Swing GUI (Graphical User interface). 
    The final product was successfully deployed two forms:</li>     
      <ul>
       <li> <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/index-jsp-136112.html"> Java Web Start Technology<a>. Launch my application from <a href="launch_page.html"> this page<a>. For troubleshooting see instructions <a href="trouble_shooting.html">here<a>.  </li>
       <li> Using <a href="https://java.net/projects/appbundler"><b>appbundler utility</b></a>, I packaged the jars into a native Mac application which can be launched from end user's machine.</li>
       <li> Documentation can be found <a href="documentation_KMCQ.html">here</a>. </li>   
       <li> Find the source codes on <a href="https://github.com/OmidSaremi/KMeansImageColorQuantizer"> GitHub</a>. </li>
     </ul>
    <li> Description of the final project of the Hadoop/MapReduce course: The data set was an anonymized sample taken from "Udacity forum". Our task was to write 
    scripts in Python (mappers and reducers) to get insight into the forum posts. There were multiple goals: 
      <ul> 
        <li>To write mappper/reducer scripts to find if there is correlation between the length of the forum "questions" and their corresponding "answer(s)".</li>
        <li>Every entry of the forum had a "tagnames" filed (a collection of tags). Write mapper/reducer scripts to find the top-10 popular tags.</li>
        <li> Write MapReduce code to find the most active hour (on the forum) of each student in the forum. If there are more than one active hour, output them all.</li>
         <li> Here you can find <a href="http://omidsaremi.org/PythonScripts">MapReduce scripts</a> I wrote in <b>Python</b> for the final project (successfully passed).  
      </ul>
    <li>As a knowledge project in Data analysis/Machine Learning, I have implemented (in Python) a simple Naive Bayes classifier, which recognizes handwritten digits. The source codes and data/data description can be found <a href="http://omidsaremi.org/NaiveBayes">here</a>.  
    <li> The training/test <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Semeion+Handwritten+Digit">data set</a> was taken from <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/"> UC Irvine Machine Learning repository</a>. </li>
